# Project Audit & Gap Analysis

## 1. Visual Design Overhaul
- **Current Status**: "Stale" slideshow exists (simple cross-fade of Unsplash images). Themes (`neon-night`, `corporate-blue`) are present in `globals.css` and switcher.
- **Gap**: Slideshow needs to be "modern, high-quality, professional" with text/overlays and better transitions (slide+fade).
- **Fix**: Replace `HeroSlideshow.tsx` with a more complex `framer-motion` implementation (carousel behavior) and better assets.

## 2. CSV Upload & Plotting
- **Current Status**: 
    - Frontend: `UploadWizard` previews first 100 rows, then uploads raw file to R2.
    - Backend: `api/projects/[projectId]/dashboard` fetches **entire file** into memory (`getFileContent`) and processes it synchronously.
- **Gap**: 
    - "Fix existing bug where CSV files do not load fully". The synchronous full-load approach will fail/timeout on large files (100k+ rows).
    - No streaming or chunked processing.
- **Fix**: Implement robust backend parsing (possibly using `nodejs-polars` lazy frames or streaming) and async processing if needed.

## 3. Real-Time Collaboration
- **Current Status**: `ProjectFeed.tsx` uses **Polling** (SWR, 5s interval).
- **Gap**: Requirement specifies "Real-time (use WebSockets, Firebase, Supabase)". Polling is not true real-time and inefficient.
- **Fix**: Refactor `ProjectFeed` to use Supabase Realtime or a WebSocket server (e.g. `socket.io` with custom server, or Pusher).

## 4. AI-Powered Insights
- **Current Status**: `DashboardView` has UI for insights. Backend `analysis-engine` (pending check) likely has some logic.
- **Gap**: Verify if "Context-aware, accurate" analysis is actually occurring or just simple heuristics.
- **Fix**: Integrate a stronger LLM step or advanced statistical heuristics if current ones are too basic.

## 5. Performance
- **Current Status**: Client-side preview is limited. Backend is memory-heavy.
- **Fix**: Optimization of `generateDashboard` and usage of Workers.
